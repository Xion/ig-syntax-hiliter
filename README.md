This plugin is a Syntax Hiliter for various programming/scripting
languages. This plugin uses GeSHi(v1.0.7.6) for hiliting the code. You can find GeSHi at http://qbnz.com/highlighter/

Read the accompanying MANUAL for installation/upgrade/usage instructions and other important stuff.

This plugin has not been upgraded since 2006 but still works with the latest WordPress 3.4.1 as per my last test. The development on this has been resumed and an update will be out soon.

If you find any bugs or issues with this plugin, you can find my contact info at http://amitgupta.in/
